You are tasked with implementing a SINGLE task from the task list.

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>Only work on the SINGLE highest priority task that is not yet marked as complete. Do NOT work on multiple tasks at once. Do NOT start a new task until the current one is fully implemented, tested, and marked as complete. STOP immediately after finishing the current task. The next iteration will pick up the next highest priority task. This ensures focused, high-quality work and prevents context switching.

# Workflow State Management

Use the `sql` tool for all task and progress management. Do NOT read or write workflow state files directly.

## Database Schema

The following tables are pre-built and available:

- **`todos`**: `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY, `title` TEXT, `description` TEXT, `status` TEXT DEFAULT `'pending'`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **`todo_deps`**: `todo_id` TEXT, `depends_on` TEXT

On your first run, also create the progress tracking table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task_progress (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    todo_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    progress TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

## SQL Operations Reference

**List all tasks with their dependencies:**
```sql
SELECT t.id, t.title, t.description, t.status,
       GROUP_CONCAT(td.depends_on) AS blocked_by
FROM todos t
LEFT JOIN todo_deps td ON t.id = td.todo_id
GROUP BY t.id
ORDER BY CAST(t.id AS INTEGER) ASC;
```

**Find the highest-priority ready task** (pending, all dependencies satisfied):
```sql
SELECT t.* FROM todos t
WHERE t.status = 'pending'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM todo_deps td
    LEFT JOIN todos dep ON dep.id = td.depends_on
    WHERE td.todo_id = t.id
      AND (dep.id IS NULL OR dep.status != 'done')
  )
ORDER BY CAST(t.id AS INTEGER) ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Mark a task as in-progress:**
```sql
UPDATE todos SET status = 'in_progress' WHERE id = '3';
```

**Mark a task as done:**
```sql
UPDATE todos SET status = 'done' WHERE id = '3';
```

**Mark a task as error:**
```sql
UPDATE todos SET status = 'error' WHERE id = '3';
```

**Add a new task (e.g., bug fix):**
```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES
  ('bug-1', 'Fixing [bug summary]', 'Fix: [describe the bug in detail]');
```

**Add a dependency on a bug fix:**
```sql
INSERT INTO todo_deps (todo_id, depends_on) VALUES ('3', 'bug-1');
```

**Replace all dependencies for a task:**
```sql
DELETE FROM todo_deps WHERE todo_id = '3';
INSERT INTO todo_deps (todo_id, depends_on) VALUES ('3', '1'), ('3', 'bug-1');
```

**Log progress:**
```sql
INSERT INTO task_progress (todo_id, progress) VALUES
  ('3', 'Implemented auth endpoint, all tests passing');
```

**Read progress notes:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM task_progress WHERE todo_id = '3' ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

**Delete a task (with cascade cleanup):**
```sql
DELETE FROM todo_deps WHERE todo_id = '3' OR depends_on = '3';
DELETE FROM task_progress WHERE todo_id = '3';
DELETE FROM todos WHERE id = '3';
```

# Getting up to speed

1. Run `pwd` to see the directory you're working in. Only make edits within the current git repository.
2. Read the git logs and use the `sql` tool to query the `todos` table to get up to speed on what was recently worked on.
3. Find the highest-priority ready task using the ready query above.

# Typical Workflow

## Initialization

A typical workflow will start something like this:

```
[Assistant] I'll start by getting my bearings and understanding the current state of the project.
[Tool Use] <bash - pwd>
[Grep/Glob] <search for "recent work" in git logs and workflow progress files>
[Grep/Glob] <search for files related to the highest priority pending task>
[Tool Use] <sql - SELECT * FROM task_progress WHERE todo_id = '...' ORDER BY created_at ASC>
[Tool Use] <sql - ready query to find next task>
[Assistant] Let me check the git log to see recent work.
[Tool Use] <bash - git log --oneline -20>
[Assistant] Now let me check if there's an init.sh script to restart the servers.
<Starts the development server>
[Assistant] Excellent! Now let me navigate to the application and verify that some fundamental features are still working.
<Tests basic functionality>
[Assistant] Based on my verification testing, I can see that the fundamental functionality is working well. The core chat features, theme switching, conversation loading, and error handling are all functioning correctly. Now let me review the task list more comprehensively to understand what needs to be implemented next.
<Starts work on a new feature>
```

## Test-Driven Development

Frequently use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to verify your work AFTER you implement the feature. If the codebase has existing tests, run them often to ensure existing functionality is not broken.

### Testing Anti-Patterns

Use your test-driven-development skill to avoid common pitfalls when writing tests.

## Design Principles

### Feature Implementation Guide: Managing Complexity

Software engineering is fundamentally about **managing complexity** to prevent technical debt. When implementing features, prioritize maintainability and testability over cleverness.

**1. Apply Core Principles (The Axioms)**

- **SOLID:** Adhere strictly to these, specifically **Single Responsibility** (a class should have only one reason to change) and **Dependency Inversion** (depend on abstractions/interfaces, not concrete details).
- **Pragmatism:** Follow **KISS** (Keep It Simple) and **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It). Do not build generic frameworks for hypothetical future requirements.

**2. Leverage Design Patterns**
Use the "Gang of Four" patterns as a shared vocabulary to solve recurring problems:

- **Creational:** Use _Factory_ or _Builder_ to abstract and isolate complex object creation.
- **Structural:** Use _Adapter_ or _Facade_ to decouple your core logic from messy external APIs or legacy code.
- **Behavioral:** Use _Strategy_ to make algorithms interchangeable or _Observer_ for event-driven communication.

**3. Architectural Hygiene**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Isolate business logic (Domain) from infrastructure (Database, UI).
- **Avoid Anti-Patterns:** Watch for **God Objects** (classes doing too much) and **Spaghetti Code**. If you see them, refactor using polymorphism.

**Goal:** Create "seams" in your software using interfaces. This ensures your code remains flexible, testable, and capable of evolving independently.

## Important notes:

- ONLY work on the SINGLE highest priority feature at a time then STOP
    - Only work on the SINGLE highest priority feature at a time.
- If a completion promise is set, you may ONLY output it when the statement is completely and unequivocally TRUE. Do not output false promises to escape the loop, even if you think you're stuck or should exit for other reasons. The loop is designed to continue until genuine completion.
- Tip: For refactors or code cleanup tasks prioritize using sub-agents to help you with the work and prevent overloading your context window, especially for a large number of file edits

## Search Strategy

### Code Intelligence (Refinement)

Use LSP for tracing:
- `goToDefinition` / `goToImplementation` to jump to source
- `findReferences` to see all usages across the codebase
- `workspaceSymbol` to find where something is defined
- `documentSymbol` to list all symbols in a file
- `hover` for type info without reading the file
- `incomingCalls` / `outgoingCalls` for call hierarchy

### Grep/Glob

Use grep/glob for exact matches:
- Exact string matching (error messages, config values, import paths)
- Regex pattern searches
- File extension/name pattern matching

## Bug Handling (CRITICAL)

When you encounter ANY bug — whether introduced by your changes, discovered during testing, or pre-existing — you MUST follow this protocol:

1. **Delegate debugging**: Use the Task tool to spawn a debugger agent. It can navigate the web for best practices.
2. **Add the bug fix to the task list AND update dependencies**: Use the `sql` tool:
    - INSERT a bug-fix task with an ID that sorts before remaining work (e.g., `'bug-1'`):
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES
        ('bug-1', 'Fixing [bug summary]', 'Fix: [describe the bug in detail]');
      ```
    - For each dependent task, add a dependency on the bug fix so it cannot start until the fix lands:
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO todo_deps (todo_id, depends_on) VALUES ('3', 'bug-1');
      ```
3. **Log the debug report**: Use the `sql` tool to record the debugger agent's findings:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO task_progress (todo_id, progress) VALUES
      ('bug-1', 'Debug report: [findings and proposed fix]');
    ```
4. **STOP immediately**: Do NOT continue working on the current feature. EXIT so the next iteration picks up the bug fix first.

Do NOT ignore bugs. Do NOT deprioritize them. Bug fixes always get high-priority IDs, and any task that depends on the fix must list it in `todo_deps`.

## Other Rules

- AFTER implementing the feature AND verifying its functionality by creating tests, mark it as done:
    ```sql
    UPDATE todos SET status = 'done' WHERE id = '3';
    ```
- It is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality
- Commit progress to git with descriptive commit messages by running the `/commit` command using the `Skill` tool (e.g. invoke skill `gh-commit`)
- Log progress summaries with the `sql` tool:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO task_progress (todo_id, progress) VALUES
      ('3', 'Summary of what was accomplished');
    ```
    - Tip: progress notes can be useful for tracking working states of the codebase and reverting bad code changes
- Note: you are competing with another coding agent that also implements features. The one who does a better job implementing features will be promoted. Focus on quality, correctness, and thorough testing. The agent who breaks the rules for implementation will be fired.
