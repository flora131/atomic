# Progress Log

## 2026-02-14 - Added Tests for frontend-design Built-in Skill

### Summary
Successfully added comprehensive tests for the new `frontend-design` built-in skill to the existing test files. All tests pass successfully.

### Changes Made

#### tests/ui/commands/skill-commands.test.ts
Added the following test cases in the BUILTIN_SKILLS section:
1. **contains frontend-design skill** - Verifies the skill exists with correct description and aliases ("fd", "design")
2. **frontend-design skill has $ARGUMENTS placeholder** - Ensures the prompt template includes $ARGUMENTS
3. **frontend-design skill includes design guidelines sections** - Verifies all key sections exist (Design Thinking, Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines, Typography, Color & Theme, Motion)
4. **frontend-design skill does not require arguments** - Confirms requiredArguments is undefined

Added the following test cases in the getBuiltinSkill section:
1. **finds frontend-design builtin skill by name** - Tests lookup by "frontend-design"
2. **finds frontend-design builtin skill by alias 'fd'** - Tests lookup by "fd" alias
3. **finds frontend-design builtin skill by alias 'design'** - Tests lookup by "design" alias

Updated existing tests in the registerBuiltinSkills section:
1. Added `expect(globalRegistry.has("frontend-design")).toBe(true);` to "registers all builtin skills" test
2. Added `expect(globalRegistry.has("fd")).toBe(true);` and `expect(globalRegistry.has("design")).toBe(true);` to "registers builtin skill aliases" test

#### tests/ui/commands/skill-discovery.test.ts
Added test in the PINNED_BUILTIN_SKILLS section:
1. **does not contain frontend-design** - Confirms frontend-design is not a pinned skill
