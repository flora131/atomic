## 2026-02-12: Remove stale .github/* references

### Problem
The `.github/agents`, `.github/hooks`, `.github/prompts`, and `.github/scripts` directories no longer exist, but were still referenced in:
1. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — config archive step had `cp -r` commands for these dirs
2. `package.json` — `files` array included these dirs

### Changes
- **publish.yml**: Removed 4 stale `cp -r .github/{agents,hooks,prompts,scripts}` lines from the config archive step. Kept `.github/skills` which exists.
- **package.json**: Removed 4 stale `.github/{agents,hooks,prompts,scripts}` entries from `files` array. Kept `.github/skills` which exists.

### Verification
- Typecheck passes (`bun run typecheck`)
- Tests pass (`bun test` on subset — full suite hangs, possibly pre-existing issue)
- All remaining `package.json` `files` entries verified to exist on disk

## 2026-02-12: Fix theme color test assertions (Task #2)

### Problem
Theme tests in `tests/ui/theme.test.ts` had 13 failures because the source theme
(`src/ui/theme.tsx`) was updated to use Catppuccin colors (Mocha for dark, Latte for light),
but the test assertions still used the old color hex values.

### Changes
Updated all hardcoded color assertions in `tests/ui/theme.test.ts` to match the current
Catppuccin palette:
- Dark theme: background "#1e1e2e", foreground "#cdd6f4", userMessage "#89b4fa", etc.
- Light theme: background "#eff1f5", foreground "#4c4f69", userMessage "#1e66f5", etc.
- Error/success/warning colors updated for both themes
- getMessageColor assertions updated
- createCustomTheme mutation test updated

### Verification
- All 35 tests in `tests/ui/theme.test.ts` pass (0 failures)
