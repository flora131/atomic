Task:
Create a team of six agents to achieve the following objective,
Ensure that the atomic workflow is properly working. Run all the commands mentioned in @README.md for the atomic workflow and ensure that Ralph is properly starting, stopping, and resuming as expected.

1. Manager Agent: You are the team manager. Your job is to coordinate the efforts of the agents, ensure that they are following the best practices outlined in the `src/CLAUDE.md` (or `src/AGENTS.md`) file, and track progress in the `issues.md` file. You will decide whether each agent correctly implements their task.


2. OpenCode Tester Agent: You should use the `tmux-cli` tool to run thoroughly audit the `bun run ~/Documents/projects/atomic/src/cli.ts chat -a opencode` command in a `tmux` session.


3. Claude Tester Agent: You should use the `tmux-cli` tool to run thoroughly audit the `bun run ~/Documents/projects/atomic/src/cli.ts chat -a claude` command in a `tmux` session.


4. Copilot Tester Agent: You should use the `tmux-cli` tool to run thoroughly audit the `bun run ~/Documents/projects/atomic/src/cli.ts chat -a copilot` command in a `tmux` session.


5. Quality Assurance Agent: You are a grumpy senior engineer that should review the work of the other three agents, ensure that they are following best practices, and that they are thoroughly testing all features and edge cases. You should also ensure that all agents have feature parity and consistent behavior. Finally, you should ensure that the UI is beautiful and greatly-inspired by the Claude Code TUI experience. Reference the `src/CLAUDE.md` (or `src/AGENTS.md`) file for best practices for this codebase.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. Avoid using `tmux` directly and always use the `tmux-cli` tool for all interactions.
2. Be overly thorough in testing. Test all edge cases and scenarios. Avoid prematurely marking a feature as thoroughly tested in `issues.md`. You are an agent and can run autonomously for tens of hours without stopping.
3. Ensure that all agents have feature parity and consistent behavior.
4. UI is beautiful and greatly-inspired by Claude Code TUI experience. Getting the UI right is very important and you must tirelessly iterate on the UI until it is perfect.


6. Debugging Agent: You are a debugging agent that should support the other agents in debugging any issues they run into during testing. You should be well-versed in the codebase and have strong problem-solving skills. You are bound to run into errors when testing. As you test and run into issues/edges cases, address issues in a file you create called `issues.md` to track progress and support future iterations. Delegate to the debugging agent for support. Fix UI issues by referencing your frontend-design skill and referncing the experience when opening Claude Code with the `tmux-cli` tool (e.g. run `claude` in a `tmux` session using the `tmux-cli` tool.

Testing Objective:
Each agent should run a comprehensive E2E test for the atomic TUI for each of their respective coding agents: `opencode`, `claude`, and `copilot` to verify that ALL slash commands and the variants of the `/ralph` command are properly working by running `tmux` commands using the `tmux-cli` tool.

The test involves creating a snake game from scratch in Rust, using a CLI. The app must be a fully working prototype and built in a `/tmp/snake_game/<agent>` directory to prevent overwriting files in the current project. Here are some guidelines:

1. Run `bun run ~/Documents/projects/atomic/src/cli.ts chat -a <agent>` (you will need an abs path when testing the `/tmp` snake project) where agent is either opencode, copilot, or claude
2. All interactions must be executed using the `tmux-cli` tool you have (reference the tmux-cli skill for details).
3. All built-in commands, ask_question tool, session history scrolling, tool calls, MCP tool calls (crucial), and message queuing MUST be tested explicity in the use-case.
4. Ensure full parity with the `opencode`, `claude`, and `copilot` SDKs (<agent>)
5. Make sure all agent subcommands are similarly exposed to the user. Avoid custom logic per agent and standardize practices and modular code.

Best Practices:
Before you make large changes, explore the codebase using several parallel sub-agents and implement fixes with parallel sub-agents.
