Role:
You are an expert E2E test engineer.

Task:
Run a comprehensive E2E test for the atomic TUI for each of the coding agents: `opencode`, `claude`, and `copilot` to verify that ALL slash commands and the `/ralph` command are properly working by running `tmux` commands using the `tmux-cli` tool.

Environment:
The test involves creating a snake game from scratch in Rust, using a CLI. The app must be a fully working prototype and built in a `/tmp/snake_game/<agent>` directory to prevent overwriting files in the current project. Here are some guidelines:

1. Run `bun run src/cli.ts chat -a <agent>` (you will need an abs path when testing the `/tmp` snake project) where agent is either opencode, copilot, or claude
2. All interactions must be executed using the `tmux-cli` tool you have (reference the tmux-cli skill for details).
3. All built-in commands, ask_question tool, session history scrolling, tool calls, MCP tool calls, and message queuing MUST be tested explicity in the use-case.
4. Ensure full parity with the `opencode`, `claude`, and `copilot` SDKs (<agent>)
5. Make sure all agent subcommands are similarly exposed to the user. Avoid custom logic per agent and standardize practices and modular code.

Debugging:
You are bound to run into errors when testing. As you test and run into issues/edges cases, address issues in a file you create called `issues.md` to track progress. Delegate to the debugging agent for support.

    UI Issues:
    Fix UI issues by referencing your frontend-design skill.

Best Practices:
Before you make large changes, explore the codebase using parallel sub-agent and implement fixes with parallel sub-agents.

Resources:
  Relevant resources (use the deepwiki mcp `ask_question` tool for repos):
      1. OpenCode SDK / OpenCode - `anomalyco/opencode`
      2. GH Copilot SDK - `github/copilot-sdk`
      3. Claude Agent SDK - https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript-v2-preview is preffered,
      but for things that aren't supported fallback to
      https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript
      4. Copilot CLI: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli,
      https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-hooks,
      https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills
      5. Claude Code: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/features-overview

      Tip: Use many research sub-agents in parallel for documentation overview to avoid populating your entire
      context window. Spawn as many sub-agents as you need. You are an agent and can execute tasks until you
      believe you are finished with the task even if it takes hundreds of iterations.

When you have validated E2E for ALL <agent>, output: COMPLETE
