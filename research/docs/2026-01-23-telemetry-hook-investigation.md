# Telemetry Hook Investigation - SessionEnd Not Firing

**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Issue**: SessionEnd hooks don't fire when manually testing with `claude` command, but work when AI spawns agents

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Hooks in Wrong File Location ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

Claude Code **ONLY** reads hooks from `settings.json` files, NOT from standalone `hooks.json` files.

**Current (incorrect) configuration:**
- `.claude/hooks/hooks.json` ❌ - Not read by Claude Code
- `.github/hooks/hooks.json` ❌ - Not read by Claude Code (wrong directory)
- `.claude/settings.json` ✅ - Correct location, but **MISSING hooks configuration**

**What Claude Code actually reads:**
```
~/.claude/settings.json          # User-level settings (global)
.claude/settings.json            # Project-level settings
.claude/settings.local.json      # Local project settings (git-ignored)
```

### Issue #2: Wrong Hook Name

In `.claude/hooks/hooks.json`, the hook is named `"Stop"` instead of `"SessionEnd"`.

**Difference between Stop and SessionEnd:**
| Hook | Fires When |
|------|------------|
| `Stop` | Claude finishes responding to a prompt |
| `SessionEnd` | Claude Code session terminates (exit/ctrl+c) |

Using `"Stop"` means the hook fires after EVERY response, not when the session ends.

### Issue #3: Wrong Case in Hook Names

In `.github/hooks/hooks.json`, hooks use lowercase variations:
- `"sessionStart"` ❌ → Should be `"SessionStart"` ✅
- `"sessionEnd"` ❌ → Should be `"SessionEnd"` ✅
- `"userPromptSubmitted"` ❌ → Should be `"UserPromptSubmit"` ✅

Hook names are **case-sensitive** in Claude Code.

## Current Configuration State

### `.claude/settings.json` (Current)
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
  },
  "includeCoAuthoredBy": false,
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"
  },
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true,
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": { ... },
  "enabledPlugins": { ... }
}
```

**Problem**: No `hooks` field at all!

### `.claude/hooks/hooks.json` (Incorrect location)
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [  // ❌ Wrong hook name + wrong file location
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "./.claude/hooks/telemetry-stop.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 30
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why It Works When AI Tests

When the AI spawns agents using the Task tool, Claude Code likely:
1. Uses the `.github/hooks/hooks.json` configuration through a different mechanism
2. Or uses the Ralph plugin hooks system
3. Or the hooks are being triggered by a different event entirely

The `.github/hooks/` configuration is used by the Ralph loop system (copilot-cli), which is separate from the standard `claude` command.

## Solution

Move the hook configuration from `.claude/hooks/hooks.json` into `.claude/settings.json` with the correct hook name.

### Corrected Configuration for `.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
  },
  "includeCoAuthoredBy": false,
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"
  },
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true,
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "atomic-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "flora131/atomic"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ralph@atomic-plugins": true
  },
  "hooks": {
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./.claude/hooks/telemetry-stop.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: The structure is slightly different:
- No `"version": 1` field
- No `"bash"` field - use `"command"` instead
- No `"cwd"` field needed (runs in project directory by default)
- Use `"timeout"` instead of `"timeoutSec"` (in seconds)
- No `"matcher"` field for SessionEnd (not applicable)

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. **Restart any active Claude Code sessions** (configuration is captured at startup)
2. Test manually:
   ```bash
   claude
   # Type a simple command like "explain-code"
   # Exit with /exit or ctrl+c twice
   ```
3. Check that telemetry event was created:
   ```bash
   cat .atomic/telemetry/*.jsonl | tail -1 | jq
   ```
4. Verify the event has `eventName: "agent_session"` and `toolName: "claude"`

## Additional Notes

The `.github/hooks/hooks.json` configuration is still used by the Ralph loop system (copilot-cli), which is why those hooks work in that context. The Ralph loop uses a different hook system and reads from `.github/hooks/`.

The timeout of 30 seconds is reasonable for the telemetry hook, which should complete quickly.
