# CLI Agent Rename Feature - Progress Log

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-20

### Completed
- Feature 1: "Rename agent keys in AGENT_KEYS and AGENT_CONFIG (source of truth)"
  - Updated AGENT_KEYS from ['claude-code', 'opencode', 'copilot-cli'] to ['claude', 'opencode', 'copilot']
  - Renamed 'claude-code' config key to 'claude' in AGENT_CONFIG
  - Renamed 'copilot-cli' config key to 'copilot' in AGENT_CONFIG
  - Verified AgentKey type is automatically updated to 'claude' | 'opencode' | 'copilot'
  - Ran typecheck - type errors in test files confirm type propagation is working correctly

### Status
- Feature 1/14 completed
- Next: Update help text examples in src/index.ts

### Notes
- Type errors in test files are expected - they reference old agent names and will be updated in subsequent features
