## 2026-02-03 - Feature Implementation: Unit test: Circular dependency detection

### Status: COMPLETED

Implemented comprehensive unit tests for circular dependency detection in the workflow resolution system (`resolveWorkflowRef`).

#### Tests Added (19 new tests)

1. **Resolution stack cleanup tests**
   - `resolveWorkflowRef clears resolution stack after successful resolution`
   - `resolveWorkflowRef clears resolution stack after failed resolution`

2. **Circular dependency detection behavior**
   - `resolveWorkflowRef(A) throws circular dependency error when A->B->A`
   - `error format includes arrow notation in chain`

3. **Non-circular dependencies work correctly**
   - `resolves leaf workflow without error`
   - `multiple resolutions of same workflow do not throw`
   - `resolution stack is cleared between independent resolutions`
   - `sequential resolution of different workflows works correctly`

4. **Resolution stack cleanup on error**
   - `resolution stack is cleared even when createWorkflow throws`
   - `resolution stack is cleared after workflow not found`

5. **Case-insensitive resolution stack tracking**
   - `resolution uses lowercase for stack tracking`
   - `case normalization in error message`

6. **Circular dependency error message format**
   - `error message format matches implementation`
   - `self-reference error includes workflow name twice`
   - `three-way cycle error includes all three workflow names`

7. **Integration: workflow registry and resolution stack interaction**
   - `hasWorkflow does not affect resolution stack`
   - `getWorkflowFromRegistry does not affect resolution stack`
   - `getWorkflowNames does not affect resolution stack`
   - `refreshWorkflowRegistry clears and reinitializes properly`

#### Implementation Details

The circular dependency detection is implemented in `src/ui/commands/workflow-commands.ts`:
- Uses a `resolutionStack` Set to track workflows currently being resolved
- Converts workflow names to lowercase for case-insensitive detection
- When a workflow is already in the stack, throws error with format:
  `Circular workflow dependency detected: workflow-a -> workflow-b -> workflow-a`
- The stack is always cleaned up in a `finally` block, even on errors

#### Test Results
- All 170 tests in tests/ui/commands/workflow-commands.test.ts pass (19 new tests added)
- No regressions detected

#### Files Modified
- tests/ui/commands/workflow-commands.test.ts - Expanded circular dependency detection tests from 2 to 19 tests
- research/feature-list.json - Updated passes to true for this feature

   - `discovers workflows in local directory`
   - `discovers workflows in global directory`
   - `discovers workflows from both directories simultaneously`
   - `correctly marks source for local vs global paths`

2. **loadWorkflowsFromDisk loads both local and global workflows**
   - `loads workflows from both local and global directories`
   - `preserves workflow metadata from both directories`

3. **local workflows override global workflows with same name**
   - `local workflow takes precedence over global workflow with same name`
   - `local workflow overrides global even with different case in name`
   - `alias collision: local alias takes precedence over global workflow`

4. **invalid workflow files are skipped with warning**
   - `skips file without default export`
   - `skips file with non-function default export`
   - `skips file with syntax errors gracefully`
   - `continues loading valid workflows even when some are invalid`
   - `handles empty workflow directory gracefully`

5. **edge cases for multi-path loading**
   - `handles missing local directory when global exists`
   - `handles missing global directory when local exists`
   - `handles both directories missing`

#### Test Results
- All 153 tests in tests/ui/commands/workflow-commands.test.ts pass (18 new tests added)

## 2026-02-03 - Feature Implementation: Add visual indicator for yolo mode vs feature-list mode

### Status: COMPLETED

Implemented visual mode indicator at the start of Ralph workflow execution to show whether the session is running in yolo (freestyle) mode or feature-list mode.

#### Changes Made

1. **Added mode display for new sessions in initRalphSessionNode()**
   - Location: src/graph/nodes/ralph-nodes.ts (lines 1497-1502)
   - After displaying "Started Ralph session: {uuid}", shows:
     - In yolo mode: `Mode: Freestyle (yolo)`
     - In feature-list mode: `Mode: Feature list (N features)` where N is the count

2. **Added mode display for resumed sessions**
   - Location: src/graph/nodes/ralph-nodes.ts (lines 1459-1464)
   - After displaying "Resuming Ralph session: {uuid}", shows the same mode indicators
   - Uses session.yolo and session.features.length for the display

3. **Refactored feature loading order**
   - Moved feature loading before the mode display to accurately show the count
   - Split the feature saving step to avoid duplicate loading

4. **Example output**:
   ```
   Started Ralph session: abc123-def456
   Mode: Feature list (5 features)
   ```
   or
   ```
   Started Ralph session: abc123-def456
   Mode: Freestyle (yolo)
   ```

#### Tests Added (7 new tests in tests/graph/nodes/ralph-nodes.test.ts)

- `displays 'Mode: Freestyle (yolo)' for yolo mode` - Verifies exact yolo mode message

### Status: COMPLETED

Removed the explicit hooks module from src/sdk/ as hooks are now passthrough to the underlying SDKs.

#### Background
The hooks system was originally designed to provide a unified interface for registering event handlers across all coding agent SDKs (Claude, OpenCode, Copilot). However, this is no longer needed because:
- Claude SDK handles .claude/settings.json hooks natively
- OpenCode SDK handles hooks natively
- Copilot SDK handles hooks natively

#### Files Removed
- `src/sdk/hooks.ts` - HookManager unified hook system (605 lines)
- `src/sdk/claude-hooks.ts` - Claude-specific SDK hooks (214 lines)
- `src/sdk/opencode-hooks.ts` - OpenCode-specific SDK hooks (846 lines)
- `src/sdk/copilot-hooks.ts` - Copilot-specific SDK hooks (590 lines)
- `tests/sdk/hooks.test.ts` - HookManager tests
- `tests/sdk/claude-hooks.test.ts` - Claude hooks tests
- `tests/sdk/opencode-hooks.test.ts` - OpenCode hooks tests
- `tests/sdk/copilot-hooks.test.ts` - Copilot hooks tests

#### Files Modified
- `src/sdk/index.ts` - Removed all hooks-related exports, added note explaining hooks are passthrough to underlying SDKs

#### Removed Exports
- `HookManager`, `createHookManager`
- Hook type exports: `UnifiedHookEvent`, `HookContext`, `HookHandler`, `HookResult`, `HookEventData`, `HookEventDataMap`
- Event data types: `BaseHookEventData`, `HookSessionStartEventData`, `HookSessionEndEventData`, `HookSessionErrorEventData`, `ToolBeforeEventData`, `ToolAfterEventData`, `ToolErrorEventData`, `MessageBeforeEventData`, `MessageAfterEventData`, `PermissionRequestEventData`, `HookSubagentStartEventData`, `SubagentEndEventData`
- Claude hook exports: `createSessionEndTelemetryHook`, `createDefaultClaudeHooks`, `createSessionStartHook`, `createPreToolUseHook`, `createPostToolUseHook`
- Copilot hook exports: `createCopilotSessionStartHandler`, `createCopilotSessionEndHandler`, `createCopilotUserPromptHandler`, `registerDefaultCopilotHooks`, `createDefaultCopilotHooks`, `CopilotHookHandlers`
- OpenCode hook exports: `createOpenCodeSessionStartHandler`, `createOpenCodeSessionIdleHandler`, `createOpenCodeSessionDeletedHandler`, `createOpenCodeCommandExecuteHandler`, `createOpenCodeChatMessageHandler`, `registerDefaultOpenCodeHooks`, `createDefaultOpenCodeHooks`, `parseRalphState`, `writeRalphState`, `deleteRalphState`, `checkFeaturesPassing`, `checkCompletionPromise`, `normalizeCommandName`, `extractCommandsFromText`, `OpenCodeHookHandlers`, `OpenCodeHookContext`

#### Test Results
- Build passes successfully
- All 162 SDK tests pass (hooks tests removed)
- All tests pass (2962 pass, 17 fail - pre-existing failures unrelated to hooks)

  - `onWorkflowResumeWithAnswer?: (requestId: string, answer: string | string[]) => void` - Callback to resume workflow with user's answer

- Added `askUserQuestionRequestIdRef` ref to store the requestId for response correlation

- Implemented `handleAskUserQuestion` callback:
  - Stores requestId in ref for response correlation
  - Converts `AskUserQuestionEventData` to `UserQuestion` format
  - Uses header or defaults to "Question"
  - Maps options using label as value (since AskUserOption only has label/description)
  - Shows question dialog via `handleHumanInputRequired`

- Added registration effect hook for `registerAskUserQuestionHandler`

- Updated `handleQuestionAnswer` to handle askUserNode responses:
  - Checks if `askUserQuestionRequestIdRef.current` is set
  - Clears the ref after processing
  - If `workflowState.workflowActive && onWorkflowResumeWithAnswer`:
    - Calls `onWorkflowResumeWithAnswer(requestId, answer.selected)` for workflow mode
  - Otherwise (standalone agent mode):
    - Gets session via `getSession()`
    - Sends answer through `session.send()` with array values joined by comma
  - Updated useCallback dependencies

- Imported `AskUserQuestionEventData` type from `../graph/index.ts`

### Tests Added (14 new tests)
- handleAskUserQuestion tests:
  - AskUserQuestionEventData has required fields
  - AskUserQuestionEventData with optional header
  - AskUserQuestionEventData with options array
  - conversion to UserQuestion format uses header or default
  - conversion preserves options with label as value
  - empty options array produces empty UserQuestion options

- handleAskUserQuestion response flow tests:
  - workflow mode calls onWorkflowResumeWithAnswer
  - standalone mode calls session.send
  - array answer is joined with comma for session.send
  - no action when session is null in standalone mode

- ChatAppProps with askUserQuestion handlers tests:
  - ChatAppProps includes registerAskUserQuestionHandler
  - ChatAppProps includes onWorkflowResumeWithAnswer
  - both handlers can be used together

- OnAskUserQuestion callback type tests:
  - accepts AskUserQuestionEventData parameter

### Test Results

## 2026-02-02 - Refactor: Remove disk-based skill loading

### Completed
- Removed SKILL_SEARCH_PATHS constant (was searching .claude/commands, .opencode/command, .github/commands)
- Removed loadSkillPrompt() function that loaded skill prompts from disk
- Removed stripFrontmatter() function that stripped YAML frontmatter from markdown files
- Removed fs imports (existsSync, readFileSync) and path import (join)

7. **Edge cases** (5 tests)
   - Concurrent tool executions all auto-execute
   - Tool execution after AskUserQuestion response maintains bypass mode
   - Empty tool name handled gracefully
   - Very long tool sequences all auto-execute
   - Comparison: prompt mode requires confirmation

8. **Cross-SDK verification** (4 tests)
   - Bypass mode works with Claude SDK configuration
   - Bypass mode works with OpenCode SDK configuration
