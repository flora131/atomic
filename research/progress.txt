# Progress Log

## 2026-02-01 - Feature: Create useMessageQueue hook

### Summary
Implemented the `useMessageQueue` custom React hook for managing a message queue state. This hook enables queuing messages during streaming and processing them sequentially after stream completion.

### Files Created
- `src/ui/hooks/use-message-queue.ts` - Hook implementation with:
  - `QueuedMessage` interface (id, content, queuedAt)
  - `UseMessageQueueReturn` interface (queue, enqueue, dequeue, clear, count)
  - `useMessageQueue` hook with FIFO queue operations
- `tests/ui/hooks/use-message-queue.test.ts` - 41 comprehensive unit tests

### Files Modified
- `src/ui/hooks/index.ts` - Added exports for the new hook and types

### Test Results
- All 41 tests pass (85 expect() calls)
- Tests cover: initial state, enqueue, dequeue, clear, count, edge cases, interface types

### Next Feature
The next highest priority feature is: "Integrate message queue into ChatApp to allow input during streaming"
