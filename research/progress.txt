# Progress Log

## 2026-02-02 - Feature Implementation: BuiltinSkill Interface

### Completed
- Created BuiltinSkill interface in skill-commands.ts
  - Added name: string field (skill name without leading slash)
  - Added description: string field (human-readable description)
  - Added aliases?: string[] field (alternative command names)
  - Added prompt: string field (full prompt content with $ARGUMENTS support)
  - Added hidden?: boolean field (hide from autocomplete)
  - Exported the interface for use in other modules

### Tests Added
- Added test suite for BuiltinSkill interface:
  - Valid BuiltinSkill has all required fields
  - BuiltinSkill supports optional aliases
  - BuiltinSkill supports optional hidden flag
  - BuiltinSkill with all optional fields

### Test Results
- All skill-commands tests pass (37 tests)
- Note: Some pre-existing test failures in other modules (builtin-commands count mismatch)

### Files Modified
- src/ui/commands/skill-commands.ts - Added BuiltinSkill interface
- tests/ui/commands/skill-commands.test.ts - Added BuiltinSkill tests

## 2026-02-02 - Feature Implementation: Commit Skill as Builtin

### Completed
- Added BUILTIN_SKILLS array with commit skill in skill-commands.ts
  - Set name to 'commit'
  - Set description to 'Create well-formatted commits with conventional commit format'
  - Set aliases to ['ci']
  - Embedded full conventional commit prompt with git commands and guidelines
  - Included $ARGUMENTS placeholder for user arguments
- Added getBuiltinSkill() helper function to look up builtin skills by name/alias
- Updated createSkillCommand() to check builtin skills first before disk-based loading
- Priority order: builtin skill > disk-based skill > slash command fallback

### Tests Added
- BUILTIN_SKILLS tests:
  - contains commit skill with correct fields
  - commit skill has $ARGUMENTS placeholder
  - commit skill includes conventional commit guidelines
  - commit skill includes git commands
  - all builtin skills have required fields
- getBuiltinSkill tests:
  - finds builtin skill by name
  - finds builtin skill by alias
  - is case-insensitive
  - returns undefined for non-builtin skill
  - returns undefined for unknown skill
- builtin skill execution tests:
  - commit command uses embedded prompt
  - commit command expands $ARGUMENTS with provided args

### Test Results
- All skill-commands tests pass (49 tests)

### Files Modified
- src/ui/commands/skill-commands.ts - Added BUILTIN_SKILLS array and getBuiltinSkill()
- tests/ui/commands/skill-commands.test.ts - Added BUILTIN_SKILLS and execution tests

## 2026-02-02 - Feature Implementation: Research-Codebase Skill as Builtin

### Completed
- Added research-codebase skill to BUILTIN_SKILLS array in skill-commands.ts
  - Set name to 'research-codebase'
  - Set description to 'Document codebase as-is with research directory for historical context'
  - Set aliases to ['research']
  - Embedded comprehensive prompt for analyzing and documenting codebase
  - Included instructions for creating research/ directory artifacts:
    - research/architecture.md - High-level architecture documentation
    - research/directory-structure.md - Directory structure mapping
    - research/tech-stack.md - Technology stack catalog
    - research/entry-points.md - Entry points and execution flows
    - research/patterns.md - Coding patterns and conventions
    - research/data-models.md - Data structures and schemas
    - research/dependencies.md - External dependencies analysis
  - Included $ARGUMENTS placeholder for focused analysis (e.g., specific modules)
  - Added guidelines for objective, factual documentation

### Tests Added
- BUILTIN_SKILLS tests:
  - contains research-codebase skill with correct fields
  - research-codebase skill has $ARGUMENTS placeholder
  - research-codebase skill includes research directory structure
  - research-codebase skill includes documentation guidelines
- getBuiltinSkill tests:
  - finds research-codebase builtin skill by name
  - finds research-codebase builtin skill by alias
- builtin skill execution tests:
  - research-codebase command uses embedded prompt
  - research-codebase command expands $ARGUMENTS with provided args

### Test Results
- All skill-commands tests pass (57 tests)
- Note: Pre-existing test failures in builtin-commands module remain (count mismatch)

### Files Modified
- src/ui/commands/skill-commands.ts - Added research-codebase to BUILTIN_SKILLS array
- tests/ui/commands/skill-commands.test.ts - Added research-codebase tests
