# Progress Log - Update/Uninstall Commands Implementation

## 2026-01-21 - Feature 1: getBinaryInstallDir() and getBinaryPath() helpers

### Completed
- Added `getBinaryInstallDir()` function to `src/utils/config-path.ts`
  - Returns `~/.local/bin` on Unix, `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows
  - Supports `ATOMIC_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable override
- Added `getBinaryPath()` function to `src/utils/config-path.ts`
  - Returns full path to binary: `<install_dir>/atomic` (Unix) or `<install_dir>/atomic.exe` (Windows)
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/config-path.test.ts`
  - 15 new tests covering all functions in config-path.ts
  - Tests for platform detection, environment variable handling, path construction
  - All 227 tests pass (212 existing + 15 new)

  - Edge cases (empty content, malformed lines, case sensitivity)

### Notes
- Network-dependent functions (getLatestRelease, downloadFile) are not tested with real network calls in unit tests
- These would be covered by integration tests
- Module exports all necessary types and functions for use by update command
