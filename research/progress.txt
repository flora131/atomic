# Progress Log

## 2026-02-01 - Feature: Create useMessageQueue hook

### Summary
Implemented the `useMessageQueue` custom React hook for managing a message queue state. This hook enables queuing messages during streaming and processing them sequentially after stream completion.

### Files Created
- `src/ui/hooks/use-message-queue.ts` - Hook implementation with:
  - `QueuedMessage` interface (id, content, queuedAt)
  - `UseMessageQueueReturn` interface (queue, enqueue, dequeue, clear, count)
  - `useMessageQueue` hook with FIFO queue operations
- `tests/ui/hooks/use-message-queue.test.ts` - 41 comprehensive unit tests

### Files Modified
- `src/ui/hooks/index.ts` - Added exports for the new hook and types

### Test Results
- All 41 tests pass (85 expect() calls)
- Tests cover: initial state, enqueue, dequeue, clear, count, edge cases, interface types

### Next Feature
The next highest priority feature is: "Integrate message queue into ChatApp to allow input during streaming"

## 2026-02-01 - Feature: Integrate message queue into ChatApp

### Summary
Integrated the `useMessageQueue` hook into the ChatApp component to allow users to type and submit messages while a response is streaming, instead of blocking input.

### Changes Made
- Imported `useMessageQueue` from hooks module
- Added `messageQueue` state using the hook after existing state declarations
- Modified `handleSubmit` to:
  - Remove the blocking behavior when `isStreaming` is true
  - Queue regular messages when streaming instead of returning early
  - Still allow slash commands to execute during streaming
  - Clear textarea after enqueue (same as after direct send)
- Updated dependency array to include `messageQueue`

### Files Modified
- `src/ui/chat.tsx` - Integrated message queue with handleSubmit logic
- `tests/ui/chat.test.ts` - Added 5 integration tests for queue behavior

### Test Results
- All 53 chat tests pass (153 expect() calls)
- All 75 hook tests pass (155 expect() calls)
- New tests cover: queue typing, FIFO order, content integrity, textarea clearing

### Behavior Changes
- Users can now type during streaming without input being blocked
- Messages typed during streaming are queued for later processing
- Slash commands still work during streaming (not queued)
- Textarea is cleared after queuing, same UX as direct send

### Next Feature
The next highest priority feature is: "Process queued messages sequentially after stream completion"
