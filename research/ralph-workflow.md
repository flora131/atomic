- sub-agent tree state is not streaming tool calls, tool call counts, stuck at "Initializing..."
- code-review stage in ralph workflow should not run after each item in the task list is complete, but only at the very end of the workflow, after all items in the task list are complete. This is because code review is a final step that should be performed after all tasks have been completed, rather than after each individual task. By waiting until the end of the workflow to perform code review, it allows for a more comprehensive review of the entire codebase and ensures that all changes have been made before the review process begins.
- when multiple tasks are runnable at the same time, we should run them in parallel instead of sequentially. This can help to speed up the overall workflow and improve efficiency. By running tasks in parallel, we can take advantage of available resources and reduce the time it takes to complete the workflow. However, it's important to ensure that tasks that have dependencies on each other are still executed in the correct order to avoid any issues or errors.
- Issue in streaming where once TODO list is marked as complete, there is a few seconds of delay until the final stream is sent and duration/final tokens output message (e.g. ⣿ Composed for 2m 47s · ↓ 21.0k tokens) is output
